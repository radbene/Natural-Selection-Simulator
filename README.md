# 🌿 Natural Selection Simulator

*A Java/JavaFX simulation of genetic adaptation and natural selection in a dynamic 2D world.*    

## 🚀 Features
- **Evolutionary Dynamics**: Herbivores with customizable genomes eat, reproduce, and mutate over generations.
- **Diverse Environments**:  
  - Globe-wrapping maps and forest fires.
  - Plant growth variants (e.g., fertile "equators").  
- **Interactive GUI**:  
  - Real-time visualization of animals, plants, and energy levels.  
  - Multiple concurrent simulations with pause/resume controls.  
- **Data & Analytics**:  
  - Track population stats, dominant genotypes, and lineage success.  
  - Export simulation data to CSV for further analysis.  
- **Customizable Rules**:  
  - Adjust mutations (random/shifted/swaps), aging effects, and chaos modes.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Java 17** + **JavaFX** (GUI)  
- **Gradle** (Build automation)  
- **SOLID principles** + **OOP design patterns**
